# Computer Use

[Français](../computer-use.md) · [Documentation](../../README.md#documentation)

Computer Use is an expert mode for the **real Windows desktop**. Once you enable it for a conversation, its agent can inspect the screen, switch applications, and use the mouse and keyboard. It uses the existing agent and model, not a separate remote desktop session or a virtual machine.

## Enable and stop

1. Open a project conversation and select an image-capable model.
2. Check **Allow Computer Use** in the composer, next to **Allow questions**. The checkbox is off by default. For a new conversation, the choice takes effect when you send the first message.
3. Give the agent a concrete task. No additional approval is requested for each application or click.
4. Use the separate **Stop Computer Use** control, or **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F10**, to stop desktop control. This does not stop Studio or cancel unrelated agent runs.

The mode is off by default and is not restored after a server restart. A conversation may retain its choice between turns within the same server process. Stop clears the active desktop authorization. Only one controller can use the shared desktop at a time. Read-only remote access cannot enable or stop it.

## Choose a global engine

Open **Preferences > Tools > Computer Use**. The engine is one global setting for this PC, stored server-side:

- **Original integration (Windows)** is the default. It uses our PowerShell/.NET worker and supports the full multi-monitor desktop, regions and native window focus.
- **Cua Driver (beta)** uses the pinned **0.28.2** Windows x64 driver, with private Studio-owned processes. It adds window accessibility inspection and element-targeted actions. It does not replace the agent or model and needs no user-managed MCP connection.

Selecting an engine does not enable control. Changing it needs the desktop off with no owner: the control stays locked while Computer Use is on, cleaning up, or in failed cleanup. An unavailable engine shows a reason; Studio never silently falls back or replays an action with another engine. The old per-session selection is gone: every conversation uses the same global engine. The native Windows guard still provides desktop exclusivity and the stop shortcut for CUA. CUA refuses to start if that shortcut is not registered. If process termination or input cleanup cannot be verified, new control remains blocked. Use Stop to retry cleanup; an off authorization state alone is not proof that cleanup finished.

## Computer Use decision model

**Preferences > Tools > Computer Use decision model** selects the model for runs with desktop authorized. The default **Same as conversation** keeps the conversation model. A named model replaces it at run start, only for turns with Computer Use authorized.

The list comes from the same catalog as the main picker, in the same menu as the conversation model picker. Models that read images are required: a model without images is refused both at save time and at run start, with no silent switch. An unavailable model is refused too. The extension gives desktop tools to the authorized run’s agent, with no separate screenshot-analysis agent.

The **Reasoning** selector next to the model offers the same levels as the conversation selector (**Same as conversation** by default). When set, that level applies to runs with desktop authorized exactly like the conversation level, even when the model stays the conversation model. Otherwise the conversation level is kept.

CUA has a narrower pixel surface in this beta. Prefer a specific `windowId`. It supports full-window images, but not region crops. Its desktop capture covers the primary display at native resolution; if either dimension exceeds 2000 pixels, choose a window instead. `maxWidth` is a long-edge limit for CUA window images, not a desktop downscaler. Multi-point drags and window-local pointer moves are refused rather than approximated. A refused focus operation is not permission to relaunch the application.

`computer_inspect` reads a CUA window accessibility tree without a screenshot. It returns bounded elements and an accessibility-only `frameId`. Use the returned `elementId` in `computer_act`, or `set_value` with `elementId` and `value` for an editable field. An empty value clears the field. These frames have no pixel coordinates. Window screenshots also include accessibility elements when available.

CUA pixel input defaults to foreground delivery; element-targeted actions default to background delivery. The optional batch-level `deliveryMode` selects `foreground` or `background`. Refusals never trigger an automatic change of delivery mode. Inspect or observe again after a batch. Results can be partial, refused or unverifiable; `executed` and input delivery do not prove task success. No end-to-end speed advantage over the original backend has been established.

## Image and focus reliability

New screenshots fit within **2000 × 2000 pixels**, preserving aspect ratio and coordinate metadata, even when a larger `maxWidth` is requested. This also limits tall portrait captures. It avoids the image-size limit reported by Opus for many-image requests without relying on another provider's tolerance.

Oversized historical Computer Use screenshots are omitted only from the transient context sent to the model, with a note to take a new observation. Their pixels are not rescaled under old coordinate metadata. Stored conversations and unrelated user images are unchanged.

The original backend waits briefly for minimized windows to restore and makes bounded native focus attempts. It verifies the actual foreground window. Windows can still refuse activation or access to a higher-privilege window; the error identifies the target and foreground window instead of claiming success. There is no elevation or Win+R workaround.

## What the agent can do

- List visible windows, focus an application, and wait for a window to appear after a launch.
- Observe the desktop, a window's visible rectangle, or a screen region.
- Move, click, double-click, drag, scroll, press key combinations, and type Unicode text.
- Take another observation to verify the result before continuing.

The native tools are `computer_status`, `computer_windows`, `computer_observe`, `computer_inspect`, `computer_act`, and `computer_release`. The capabilities below depend on the selected backend. Tools cannot enable the mode themselves. Root agents and their native subagents share the same conversation authorization and desktop controller.

`computer_observe` returns an actual image to the model, plus its dimensions and a frame identifier. Actions use coordinates from that image. For the original backend, Studio maps them to physical screen pixels, including scaled captures and negative monitor origins. CUA keeps its own snapshot-bound coordinate space. Each action batch requires a fresh observation. If an action times out, the agent must observe the current state rather than blindly replay it. Every screenshot is point-in-time and can show loading or unsettled UI, not settled UI.

After launching an app, wait for its window with `computer_windows` (`action: "wait"`), focus it if needed (`action: "focus"`), then observe that window before claiming an outcome. Waiting is read-only, bounded, and cancellable: it never focuses, launches, or captures. Filters `processName` (case-insensitive exact match, `.exe` suffix accepted), `title` (case-insensitive substring), and `windowId` combine with AND, and at least one nonempty filter is required. `timeoutMs` accepts an integer from 100 to 20000, default 10000. The response carries `found`, `timedOut`, `window` on success, the matching `windows` list, `elapsedMs`, and a note. `found` means the window exists, not that app UI or sound is ready. `timedOut` means it was not seen within budget, not that the app failed. If focus changes, observe again instead of repeating the launch or acting from a stale frame.

`computer_act` accepts `observeAfter` plus `observeOptions` (`windowId`, `region`, `maxWidth`) for the verification capture. By default verification reuses the original frame capture options; `observeOptions: {}` requests the whole desktop. A new window can appear on another monitor, so prefer `wait` plus `observe` of the new window before acting on it. Every result carries `applicationState: "unverified"` because sent input is not task success. If the verification capture fails after successful input, the result keeps `executed` plus `observationError: {code, message}` without an overall failure or replay; observe again instead of replaying the batch.

## Real desktop implications

This mode is not an isolation boundary. Actions affect your open applications, files, accounts and dialogs. Screen images can contain private information and are sent to the selected model provider as part of the agent conversation. Normal provider and native conversation retention apply. Routine status polling does not include screenshot pixels.

Do not use the mouse or keyboard at the same time as the agent. Keep sensitive windows out of the captured region. Stop is best effort for actions already dispatched: it cannot undo a click, a submission, or a file operation that has already happened.

## Windows requirements and limits

- Windows with an unlocked, interactive desktop is required. Other systems report the feature as unavailable.
- The original helper uses Windows PowerShell and .NET. CUA is bundled for Windows x64 with a pinned MIT license and checksums. Neither mode requires a separately configured MCP server.
- Windows privilege boundaries still apply. UAC secure desktop and higher-privilege applications are not bypassed. Studio does not automatically elevate itself.
- Original-backend window observations capture visible screen pixels, not a hidden or minimized application's backing surface. An overlapping window can therefore appear in the image.
- Display or focus changes can invalidate an observation. The agent must observe again when asked.
- The hotkey depends on successful registration by the native helper. The separate Studio stop control is also available.

## Development and validation

The Node driver starts its hidden native helper lazily. A session-scoped manager owns authorization and frames. A private native bridge binds tool calls to the real run and native subagent ledger. The extension sends image content through the existing provider pipeline.

To prepare the pinned CUA files in a development checkout, run `npm run cua:prepare`. The command verifies a cached archive or downloads the pinned release, stages the driver and its license, and never executes it. Windows x64 builds require the verified sidecar; other platforms do not bundle it.

```sh
npm run test:computer-use
npm run test:cua
npm run test:computer-use:ui
npm run test:computer-use:native
npm run test:computer-use:worker
powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File runtime/computer-use-worker.ps1 -JobSelfTest
node scripts/test-cua-job-adoption.mjs --mode=both
```

Windows Job checks use only private process fixtures. They do not initialize desktop capture, input, focus or the global hotkey.

Automated checks use a fake desktop driver and synthetic images. The native-agent integration check uses the installed engine with a local deterministic provider, temporary state and isolated processes. These checks do not capture the personal desktop, move the real pointer, or make paid model calls. They do not replace a coordinated real-desktop acceptance test for input behavior, monitor scaling, Windows focus restrictions and the global hotkey.
